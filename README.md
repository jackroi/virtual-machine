## üßê About <a name="about"></a>
A simple virtual machine, with register file and stack, able to execute simple machine code (proprietary machine code).
<br>
Documentation (italian language):
- [Supported instructions](./docs/instructions.pdf)
- [Project specifications](./docs/project-specifications.pdf)

This project was realized for the C programming course of Ca' Foscari University of Venice.

### Note
The code is abundantly commented as required by the project specifications, and for future reference.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name="getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
A Unix based distrubution with these software installed is needed (WSL supported, too):
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Building
Clone/Download the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackroi/virtual-machine.git
```

Enter into virtual-machine folder and run `make` command to compile the source code.

```bash
cd virtual-machine
make
```

If all went well, you should see `vm.out` file into the project directory.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
The virtual machine supports 2 commands:
- run: execute a virtual machine program
- print: print the source code of a program

### Run a program
```bash
./vm.out run machine-code.cvm
```
Executes `machine-code.cvm`.

### Print a program
```bash
./vm.out print machine-code.cvm
```
Prints the source code of `machine-code.cvm`.

### Test programs
Under `test/all` folder you can find simple test programs (file `.cvm`).
